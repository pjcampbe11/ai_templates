# Guide to Using the Red Team Operation Plan Template for CI/CD Pipeline Attacks

## Introduction
This guide explains how to use the provided YAML template to generate a customized Red Team Operation Plan focusing on CI/CD pipeline attacks. By leveraging GPT-4-Plus and references like MITRE ATT&CK and real-world case studies, this plan is designed to outline a comprehensive attack strategy.

## Prerequisites
- **Requirements**:
  - Access to ChatGPT with GPT-4-Plus.
  - Familiarity with CI/CD attack scenarios, such as those listed in [MITRE ATT&CK Techniques](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/enterprise/).
  - A designated file location for saving the output, e.g., `Red Team OP Plan_CICD Pipeline Attack.md`.

## Step-by-Step Guide to Using the Template
### Step 1: Upload the Template File
1. Open ChatGPT and upload the provided YAML template file.
  
### Step 2: Provide User Input
1. **Main Prompt**: Base question for ChatGPT (e.g., "Generate 1 Red Team Operation focusing on CICD attacks").
2. **User-Provided Source**: Reference URL (e.g., [NCC Group’s CI/CD pipeline compromises](https://www.nccgroup.com/us/research-blog/10-real-world-stories-of-how-we-ve-compromised-cicd-pipelines/)).
3. **GPT Version**: Specify “GPT-4-Plus” to ensure optimal responses.

### Step 3: Generate the Response
1. In ChatGPT, initiate the response generation process.
2. Specify the output filename as `Red Team OP Plan_CICD Pipeline Attack.md`.

### Step 4: Save the Output
1. Once generated, save the markdown file as instructed.
2. Review and make any necessary adjustments for clarity or further customization.

## Template Options and Token Usage Breakdown
### Options
- **Base Prompt**: Customize to target specific attack scenarios (e.g., CI/CD, credential theft).
- **User-Provided Sources**: Add multiple references if desired to tailor the operation based on specific case studies.
- **Response Format**: Adjust the structure, whether as step-by-step TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, Procedures) or a summarized overview.

### Token Usage
- Token count may vary based on prompt length and source material.
- **Average Token Use**: Simple prompts average around 500-800 tokens.
- **Detailed Requests**: More complex prompts or multiple sources can reach 1,000-1,500 tokens.
- **Optimization Tips**: Limit reference URLs or prompt length to stay within token limits.

## Troubleshooting and Best Practices
- If token limits are exceeded, simplify prompts or reduce reference material.
- After generating the output, review for accuracy and formatting.
